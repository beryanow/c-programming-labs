DESCRIPTION:
Enumerate the shifts using Dijkstra's method. 

INPUT:
String #1: a P shift, that contains 1 to 10 symbols within the range of 0 to 9.
String #2: an integer non-negative N number, that signifies how many shifts must be generated, starting from the P shift.

OUTPUT:
If the first string is not the shift that contains the 0 to 9 figures' set, then "bad input" must be printed. Otherwise, first N shifts after the P shift in lexicographical order must be printed. Every string contains only one shift. If P shift is the last shift in lexicographical order, then nothing must be printed.
