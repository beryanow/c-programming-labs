DESCRIPTION:
Change b1 based number's numeral system to b2 based one.

INPUT:
String #1: integer-valued b1 and b2 based numbers within the range of 2 to 16 - bases of the initial and final numeral systems accordingly, divided with blanks.
String #2: 1 to 12 b1 based figures, probably divided with dots to make fractional parts. This is a b1 based number's notation. There must be no more than 13 symbols in the notation.

OUTPUT:
If b1 and b2 values are not within the range of 2 to 16 or there is no b1 based notation in the second string, then "bad input" must be printed.
Otherwise, a b2 based integer part's notation and a dot with the first 12 b2 based figures of decimal part's notation (if exists) must be printed.
