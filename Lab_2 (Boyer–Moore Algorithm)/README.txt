DESCRIPTION:
Print the report of Boyer-Moore's searching for the substring in the string algorithm.

INPUT:
String #1: a pattern of 1 to 16 symbols. 
The pattern can contain any symbol except the one of the string's end.
String #2: an arbitrary amount of symbols (text).

OUTPUT:
The report of Boyer-Moore's searching for the substring in the string algorithm must be printed (every symbol's position in the text, that was ever compared with a symbol from the pattern).
Positions are counted from 1 in the text. The algorithm searches for all pattern's entries to the text.
